# Storage Killer

*Created by:* SMH (Mejban Kadir and Jay Jordan)

## Description

Storage Killer is a hypothetical malware project designed for educational purposes. Its primary function is to overwhelm a system by generating an excessive number of large binary files. Once activated, Storage Killer rapidly consumes disk space, leading to system instability, crashes, and potential data loss.

## Features

- Generates large binary files in an endless loop.
- Rapidly fills disk space to incapacitate the system.
- Simulates the effects of malware for educational and research purposes.

## Impact

- *Disk Space Saturation:* Fills the system's storage capacity, causing performance degradation and application crashes.
- *Data Corruption:* Potentially corrupts files and applications due to lack of available disk space.
- *Recovery Challenges:* Complicates data recovery efforts, requiring manual file deletion or system restoration.

## Installation

This project is intended for educational use only. To run the Storage Killer simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
